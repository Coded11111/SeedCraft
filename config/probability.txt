The probability of generating a valid seed phrase depends on the quality of the word list (dictionary) used and the length of the seed phrase.
In the program we use a list of words from the file `bip39.txt`, which, as a rule, contains words from the BIP-39 standard,
used to create mnemonic seed phrases in cryptocurrency wallets.

The BIP-39 standard provides for the use of 2048 different words.
If the seed phrase is, for example, 12 words long (which is standard for many cryptocurrency wallets),
then the total number of possible combinations will be 2048^12, which is a very large number.

However, it is worth considering that the generation of seed phrases in the program is carried out by randomly selecting words from a list.
This means that as a result of such generation, both valid and invalid seed phrases can be generated.

Thus, the probability of generating a valid seed phrase in this program will depend on
how randomly and evenly words are selected from the list, as well as the size of the list of words and the length of the seed phrase itself.
